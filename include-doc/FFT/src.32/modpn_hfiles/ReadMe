(1) Static functions and variables cannot be called out side of the .so lib 

    all functions in AS.h:
    ----------------------
    static inline void MulHiLoUnsigned(sfixn *h, sfixn *l);
    static void MulHiLoUnsigned(usfixn *h, usfixn *l);
    
    and all fns in inlineFuncs.h
       

    "the variable cannot be static and extern at the same time"

    "Within a class, static means that the function or variable is only there
once, for the class, not for each instance of it. Same for a local
static variable, if you count calling a function as "instantiating" it.
Well, and a static variable/function on namespace scope is there for
this one translation unit. It always has a meaning similar to "there is
only one".
