The \texttt{TriangularSet} class is a container class for handing
triangular sets, \emph{i.e.}, sets of polynomials of
$\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, with $\mathbb{K}$ a field, and variable
ordering $x_1<\cdots x_n$, with pairwise distinct main variables. This
class is intended mainly to support the regular chain classes. 
For the notions of a regular chain and a triangular set see
\small{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_chain}}
and \small{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%27s_method_of_characteristic_set#Triangular_set}}
and as the references therein.
