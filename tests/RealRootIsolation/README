# To use our realroot, it needs "examples" folder (can be extracted from 
examples.zip) under the same directory as the "BPAS" folder
# Usage: ./realroot <test =0..2> <example =1..8/1..53> <degree =at most 2^16>

The first argument can 0, 1 or 2
    0 is for Taylor shift
    1 is for univariate isolation
    2 is for multivariate isolation
    Any other number is for internal test only
The second argument is the example number (1..8) in the case of Taylor shift
   or univariate isolation whereas it is the example number (1..53)
   in the case of multivariate isolation
The third argument is the degree in the case of Taylor shift
   or univariate isolation

IMPORTANT: there is a hidden argument at last, which can be 1 or 0
depending on whether or not the results should be checked.
