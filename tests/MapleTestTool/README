To build this directory make sure that your CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH is set to include the path to your maple include directory.
On my machine that is: 
'export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:$MAPLE_HOME/extern/include'

To link with the built object file, ensure you also include '-lmaplec -lrt' and likely, also set up your library environment variable.
On my machine that is: 
'LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$MAPLE_HOME/bin.X86_64_LINUX
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MAPLE_HOME/bin.X86_64_LINUX'

NOTE: if you include maplec.h before bpas.h you will get some horrible errors out of gmp
NOTE: You must have the environment variable MAPLE set to point to the install location of maple.
      It cannot be MAPLE_HOME, the environment variable must be exactly 'MAPLE'. The internal libraries
      of maple use this environment varibale. (A wonderful undocumented dependency)
NOTE: In Maple 2017 restarting from C is broken. Variable names will not be reset.
