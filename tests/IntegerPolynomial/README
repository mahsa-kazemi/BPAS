# Usage: ./mul <size> <number of bits> <algorithm number> <check?>

The first argument is the size of an input polynomial (two input polynomials are assumed with the same size).

The second argument is the number of bits for the coefficients of the input polynomials.

The third argument is for specifying the algorithm
    ** 0   Naive (Schoolbook)
    ** 1   Kronecker Substitution
    ** 3   4-Way Toom-Cook
    ** 4   Classical Devide & Conquer
    ** 5   8-Way Toom-Cook
    ** 6   Two-Convolution method
    ** 10  Final (Adaptive, using all methods)

The fourth argument whether to check the result:
    ** 0 Skip checking
    ** 1 Check the result
