# BPAS
Basic Polynomial Algebra Subprograms

The Basic Polynomial Algebra Subprograms (BPAS) library provides
support for arithmetic operations with polynomials on modern
computer architectures, in particular hardware accelerators.
Typical operations are polynomial multiplication, multi-point evaluation
and interpolation, real root isolation for both univariate
and multivariate systems. Its code is written in C/C++ with
CilkPlus extension targeting multi-core processors.
